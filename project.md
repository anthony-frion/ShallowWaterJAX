## Project description 
We consider a simulator with time-varying system state $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^K$ and constant parameters $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^P$. The simulators is defined by numerical integration of tendencies $f$ that are functions of current state $x_t$, resulting a deterministic update $\mathcal{M}$ \\

$\textbf{Data assimilation.}$ We seek for such an initial state for the simulator/emulator that predictions would match to available observation.
