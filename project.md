## Project description 
We consider a simulator with time-varying system state $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^K$ and constant parameters $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^P$. The simulators is defined by numerical integration of tendencies $f$ that are functions of current state $x_t$, resulting a deterministic update $\mathcal{M}$ \\

$\textbf{Data assimilation.}$ We seek for such an initial state for the simulator/emulator that predictions would match to available observation.

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{DA}(\mathbf{x}_0; \tsr{\lambda}) = \frac{1}{N_1} (\tsr{x}_0 - \tsr{x}_b)^2 + \frac{1}{N2}\sum{t=t_1}^{t_2} ( \tsr{y}t - \mathcal{H}(\hat{\mathcal{M}}^t{\tsr{\theta}}(\tsr{x}_0; \tsr{\lambda})) )^2
\end{equation}
